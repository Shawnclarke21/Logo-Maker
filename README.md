# Logo-Maker

## Description
in this project i am demonstarting my knowledge of objects by creating an svg generator using shapes and lettering to create a logo. in this challange we had no starter code so it took me a few tries to figure out what route to take to get a project that would actually do what i wanted to do. so what exactly does this application do you might wonder. this application is used to create svg logos by answering a series of promts that are given through the terminal after running a node index.js command. after running that youll get questions about what letters would you like to have in the logo what colors along as what shape would you like to use and after answering them all youll be greeted with a your file has been updated showing that your new logo has been created.

## how to run this
to run this project you simply have to be able to access my github and clone it down to your own device then after pulling my code you run the node index command.
